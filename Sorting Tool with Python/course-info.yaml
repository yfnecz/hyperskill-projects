summary: "<div><div class=\"alert alert-primary\">You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>In the modern\
  \ world, data has become so abundant that processing it is no easy business. How\
  \ can anyone make sense of all those words and numbers? In this project, you will\

  \ the necessary calculations on them. Data is waiting to be sorted!</p></div><br/><br/>Learn\
