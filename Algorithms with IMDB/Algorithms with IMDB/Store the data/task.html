<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Before we start creating algorithms, you need some input data to form a dataset. In our project, we are going to use a collection of movie titles and ratings from IMDB. It is a CSV file that can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/518027/movies.csv" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">movies.csv</a>.</p>
<p>It's also important to decide on the format to store the data. We will use it later to implement features for searching and sorting by ratings, so try to choose the format that will be easy to use. It's possible to pass this stage with any storage format, but you may want to change it in the later stages.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage, you need to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <em>movies.csv</em>;</li>
<li>Read every line of the comma-separated data file. The first part is the movie title, and the second one is the corresponding movie rating;</li>
<li>Store the data in a format of your liking. No quotes are expected in the final output, so make sure there are no quotes left in the movie titles;</li>
<li>Print the data, separating the title and rating by a '<code class="java"> - </code>', as shown in the example. Print each movie on a new line.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Use <code class="java">encoding="UTF-8"</code> <span style="color: #000000;">for reading data from the file.</span></p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>output of your program</em></p>
