<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The next step is to carry out a <strong>linear search</strong> over the resulting set from the previous stage. Implement a linear search algorithm that looks for movies with a rating of 6. Print the corresponding movie titles like in the Example.</p>
<p>The time complexity for the linear search is <span class="math-tex">\(O(n)\)</span>, where <strong><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span></strong> is the number of elements. Please, pay attention to how long it takes for your code with the linear search algorithm to execute over this dataset.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Iterate over data;</li>
<li>Check if the rating of each element is equal to 6;</li>
<li>If yes, print the movie title and the rating like in the previous stage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you converted the ratings to <code class="java">float</code>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Don't forget that you can refer to functions for better code readability.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>output of your program</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hercules - 6.0
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - 6.0
Finding You - 6.0</code></pre>
