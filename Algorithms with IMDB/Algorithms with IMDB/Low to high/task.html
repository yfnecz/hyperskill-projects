<p>Implementation of the linear search is straightforward and undemanding. It is also slow if you have a large dataset or when the item is at the end of a list. To improve time complexity, we need to implement a better algorithm. But first, let's talk about how to arrange data in either ascending or descending order based on the movie ratings.</p>
<p>In this stage, you need to sort the data by implementing <strong>bubble sort</strong>. This time, complexity is <span class="math-tex">\(O(n^2)\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> is the number of elements. Again, mind how much time it takes for your algorithm to execute.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your program should do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the ratings of the first and second elements. If the rating of the first movie is greater than the second one, swap them;</li>
<li>Next, compare the second and third elements. If the second one is greater than the third one, swap them. Continue comparing and swapping the elements until you reach the very end of the list;</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps <span class="math-tex">\(n-1\)</span> times where <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> is the number of elements;</li>
<li>Print the sorted data in the format as shown in the example.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>a sorted array</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Hercules - 6.0
The Avengers - 8.0
The Shawshank Redemption - 9.3</code></pre>
