  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>We all know\
  \ how hard it is to choose a movie for a party with friends! Why not invent an algorithm\
  \ that will help you with the task? Create a small program that sorts movies according\
  \ to the rating of your choice and learn the basics of time complexity analysis\
  \ and various searching and sorting algorithms.</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at\
