<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In the project's first stage, you'll create the Stock Analyzer Assistant by giving it a <code class="java">name</code> and <code class="java">instructions</code>. You'll also create a <code class="java">Thread</code> object where you will be able to interact and communicate with the assistant, and finally, you'll start a <code class="java">Run</code> instance to execute the assistant and process the user's prompts; this basic configuration will set the stage for the assistant's future development and functionality.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Your primary task is initializing and configuring the Stock Analyzer Assistant using the OpenAI API. This involves the creation of an assistant instance, setting up a communication thread, and initiating a run to execute the instructions from a simple prompt.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Before moving on, to securely store the API keys in this project, you should consider using environment variables. You can use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this package</a> to load a <code class="java">.env</code> file.</p></div><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:</p><p><strong>1. Set up the Assistant:</strong> Begin by configuring the assistant. Set a <code class="java">name</code> and <code class="java">instructions</code> for the assistant. Use the <code class="java">assistants.create()</code> method to create the assistant. For this scenario, set <code class="java">stock_analyzer_assistant</code> as the <code class="java">name</code> of the assistant and for the <code class="java">instructions</code> use the following string:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">"You're an experienced stock analyzer assistant tasked with analyzing and visualizing stock market data."</code></pre><p><strong>2. Validate assistant existence:</strong> Implement a check to determine if an assistant named <code class="java">stock_analyzer_assistant</code> already exists. If it does, use the existing assistant; if not, proceed to create a new assistant with this name. You can achieve this by leveraging the <code class="java">assistants.list()</code> method to search for existing assistants.</p><p><strong>3. Create a Thread object:</strong> Once the assistant setup is confirmed, create a <code class="java">Thread</code> object; this thread serves as a conversation context where the assistant receives tasks and returns responses. Utilize the <code class="java">threads.create()</code> method to accomplish this step.</p><p><strong>4. Send a message to the Thread:</strong> Make use of the <code class="java">threads.messages.create()</code> method to send a message to the thread. You can send any message you want as the response from the assistant won't be checked, but we suggest that you send a message with a short prompt like:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">"Tell me your name and instructions. YOU MUST Provide a DIRECT and SHORT response."</code></pre><p><strong>5. Execute a Run Instance:</strong> Finally, execute a <code class="java">Run</code> instance by linking the thread with the assistant ID. This action triggers the assistant's processing of the user's request. The execution can be initiated using the <code class="java">threads.runs.create()</code> method with the thread and assistant ID information.</p><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p><strong>Example 1: Creating and executing the assistant</strong></p><p>When you run the Python program, the Assistant should be created (if it does not exist), and a <code class="java">Thread</code> should be initiated. After sending a message to the <code class="java">Thread</code> object, a <code class="java">Run</code> instance should be executed to start the analysis:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">No matching `stock_analyzer_assistant` assistant found, creating a new assistant with ID: asst_t03xkYG47OcKmt2wNP6CPOiY
Thread created with ID: thread_FFOOs1l4M4GT8cgMIjan7nHn
Run initiated with ID: run_xyFXFGkpTpaEb1P9MHlyDt4d
</code></pre><p><strong>Example 2: Assistant already exists</strong></p><p>If the Assistant already exists, your program should use the existing <code class="java">stock_analyzer_assistant</code> to create a <code class="java">Thread</code> and execute the <code class="java">Run</code> instance:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Matching `stock_analyzer_assistant` assistant found, using the first matching assistant with ID: asst_t03xkYG47OcKmt2wNP6CPOiY
Thread created with ID: thread_EEOOs1l4M4GT8cgMIjan7nHn
Run initiated with ID: run_abFXFGkpTpaEb1P9MHlyDt4d
</code></pre><p>Ensure that your program outputs all necessary information, including the creation of the assistant, the Thread, and the Run instance, following the specified formats for IDs and messages.</p>
